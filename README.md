The Leaf Disease Detection project aims to develop a sequential model for accurately classifying the health status of leaves, categorizing them as Healthy, Scab, or Rust. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model is trained on a diverse dataset of leaf images, enabling it to learn and identify key features associated with each condition.
